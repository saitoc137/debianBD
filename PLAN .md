In the last month of 2022, I got a lot of things to do. I have somethings I want to do but another task I can not complete it with the positive attitude.
In this month I have to prepare CET4 and my final exam.

So I must learn about how to make a executable plan.

First step: outlined all of things you want to and you have to do.
For example: I want to learn data structure and do some practice questions about it, how to control linux opreation and make a project about recongnize QRcode with openCV C++. But I have to nucleic acid testing and 3 units powerpoints of chamistry. Do not forget to pick up express deliveries. 
In fact those things are include your hobbies, daily chores and three meals per day.

Second step: stats all of things you do and how much time you pay for every single task.
The statistics should include everythings you did all day.

Third step: divided your whole day into 5 or 6 parts.
My opinion is using three meals to boundaries and you will have four part in one day.
